# AI Recommendations with ChatGPT (2022-12-29)

**Media Hoarder** with its plethora of metadata and filtering capabilities is already extremely useful for discovering movies in your collection based on certain aspects like genres, age rating, people involved, plot keywords, filming locations and many more.

However, [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - the artifical intelligence chatbot - is perfectly capable to recommend movies when asked. Questions like

- "Provide a list of oscar winning movies of 2020 and their IMDB IDs"
- "Provide a list of mind-bending movies and their IMDB IDs"
- "Provide a list of action movies where the protagonist is female and wields a shotgun and their IMDB IDs"

lead to answers which **Media Hoarder** can use to filter by.

So with Version 1.1.0 **Media Hoarder** implements just that: an interface to ChatGPT. Ask ChatGPT anything about movies and please keep in mind to also ask for IMDB IDs and **Media Hoarder** will use the answers as a filter for your movie night :)

The AI recommendation feature helps in getting a list of movies according to your criteria as a quick start. The filtering capabilities and metadata in **Media Hoarder** will yield more exact results in most cases.
