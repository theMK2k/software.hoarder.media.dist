# 2nd Birthday - TV Series Support (2024-09-23)

**Media Hoarder** is now 2 years old and I'm happy that it finally supports TV series with v1.4.0 \o/

Of course TV series support was on the roadmap from the beginning and inspired by <https://whattowatchon.tv/> it was clear to me that **Media Hoarder** had to offer episode heatmaps, it's just too awesome to see the distribution of ratings of all the episodes at once.

Actual work on TV series support began after an individual by the name of **kolbdog3333** (later also known as **kolbdog323**) joined the very quiet github issues space of **Media Hoarder** on Oct 18 2023 and asked for it.

The first code commit of the feature was on Dec 6 2023. End of December 2023 I decided to create a beta version with the first steps towards TV series support so we are able to discuss new aspects on iterations of the software.

Almost a full year with many of those beta releases and even more discussions followed. Yes, in some regards I'm a perfectionist and definitely not on the "ship fast and break things" side. I'm really happy with the result and I hope **you** are too, so here it is: TV series support in **Media Hoarder** v1.4.0.

Thanks **kolbdog323** for your feedback and patience. Without your input TV series in **Media Hoarder** would miss some interesting aspects and probably contain the one or other extra bug :D
